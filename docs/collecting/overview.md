# Collecting the data

The [guide](../guide/start-here.md) explains what each metric counts. This page covers
where those facts are kept in a clinic's systems, which route to take to get them out,
and what every route has to get right.

## Where each fact lives

Almost every site has **at least two sources**:
- the CoCM registry, or whatever stands in for one;
- the EHR or practice-management system.

NYS notes that the data for metrics 9 and 10 is "not tracked in your CoCM registry." Medicaid
status usually isn't in the registry either, so every Medicaid metric needs both
sources.

| Fact | Usual source | Needed for | Guide page |
|---|---|---|---|
| Enrollment and discharge | **Registry**; otherwise an EHR program-enrollment record; as a last resort, CoCM billing (disclosed) | Metrics 1–8 | [Enrollment and discharge](../guide/concepts/enrollment-and-discharge.md#where-the-data-lives) |
| Coverage, with dates | **Practice management or billing** | Metrics 2–8 | [Medicaid](../guide/concepts/medicaid.md#where-the-data-lives) |
| Clinical contacts and outreach | **Registry** contact log; otherwise BHCM encounters in the EHR | Metric 5, inactivity discharge | [Contacts and reviews](../guide/concepts/contacts-and-reviews.md#where-the-data-lives) |
| Symptom scales on the caseload | **Registry**; otherwise EHR questionnaires or flowsheets | Metrics 5–8 | [Scales and outcomes](../guide/concepts/scales-and-outcomes.md#where-the-data-lives) |
| Primary diagnosis and primary scale | **Registry**; otherwise the diagnosis on the CoCM episode | Metrics 6–8 | [Scales and outcomes](../guide/concepts/scales-and-outcomes.md#primary-scale) |
| Psychiatric case reviews | **Registry**; otherwise consultant notes, often unstructured | Metric 8 | [Contacts and reviews](../guide/concepts/contacts-and-reviews.md#psychiatric-case-review-metric-8) |
| Practice visits with codes and provider type | **EHR or practice management** | Metric 9 | [Screening](../guide/concepts/screening.md#where-the-data-lives) |
| PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 across the practice | **EHR**, every questionnaire and flowsheet that holds one | Metrics 9–10 | [Screening](../guide/concepts/screening.md#where-the-data-lives) |
| Date of birth | **EHR or practice management** | Metric 9 | — |
| BHCM FTE | **The program lead**, attested | Metric 11 | [BHCM FTE](../guide/concepts/bhcm-fte.md#where-the-data-lives) |

**Asking for the data.** Most of these facts are in someone else's system. Ready-to-send
requests for each report, with the exact columns, are in [asking for the data](requests.md).

## Pick your route

All three routes produce the same facts. Most sites end up mixing them: the registry
for the CoCM facts, and the EHR for everything else.

### 1. A spreadsheet registry

**For:** sites whose CoCM registry is a spreadsheet, and sites without a report writer.

Fill in the reporting workbook from the registry spreadsheet and one or two standard
reports the practice-management system can already run (visits, PHQs, coverage). The
calculator page reads the workbook directly. See [the workbook route](workbook.md).

- **Cost:** some manual work each month, mostly the visit and screening data for metric 9.
- **Risk:** hand-copied dates and missing rows. Keep the copying to a minimum and check
  counts against the source.

### 2. A registry product plus an EHR report

**For:** sites with a dedicated CoCM registry, whether a commercial
measurement-based-care platform, a registry the site built, or one built into the EHR.

Export the CoCM facts from the registry, and the coverage, visits and practice-wide PHQs
from the EHR. A registry mapping says which registry field supplies each fact, and
where the registry falls short.

- Mappings so far: [a prototype CoCM registry](registries/prototype-cocm-registry.md).
- **Watch for:**
  - contact logs that record only whether the patient was reached, not whether treatment
    was delivered;
  - episodes closed without an end date;
  - scales the registry doesn't support.

### 3. EHR only

**For:** sites that track CoCM in the EHR itself, with no separate registry.

Everything comes from EHR reports, written by the site's report writer from
[what every EHR report must produce](ehrs/README.md).

- **Hardest facts:**
  - **Enrollment:** a structured program-enrollment record, if the EHR has one; otherwise
    billing, disclosed.
  - **Which contacts delivered treatment:** encounter types and signed notes.
  - **The primary scale:** usually the default mapping, disclosed.
  - **Case reviews:** often only in consultant notes.
- **FHIR:** a site that can export from its EHR's FHIR API can give the calculator the
  export instead of writing reports for the EHR half. The calculator reads Patient,
  Coverage, Encounter (with Claim) and Observation resources, as Bundles or bulk-export
  NDJSON, into patients, coverage, visits and PHQ results. FHIR doesn't help with the
  CoCM-specific facts (enrollment, contact purpose, case reviews), because EHRs don't
  expose them in a standard form; those still come from the registry or the workbook.
  The calculator combines the two, as long as both use the same patient id (see
  [FHIR in the tooling plan](../tooling.md#reading-fhir)).

## What every route must get right

### One patient id

The registry and the EHR have to identify the same patient the same way, or the two
halves never join. Use the **MRN** as `patient_id` in every source. Don't use a
registry's internal id, which the EHR never sees.

Within the site, keep the MRN as it is. The calculator runs at the site, and its list of
the patients each rate didn't count is easier to act on when it shows MRNs. **Before tables leave
the site** (to a vendor, a consultant, or anyone helping with the reporting), replace
each MRN with its pseudonym:

1. **Make a key, once.** At the command line:

```bash
python3 -m calculator.pseudonymize new-key site.key
```

   Or use **Create a new key** on the calculator page. Keep the key file somewhere safe at
   the site, and use the same key every month: a new key gives every patient a new
   pseudonym.
2. **Pseudonymize the tables with it.** Load the key on the calculator page before adding
   files, then download the tables. Or at the command line:

```bash
python3 -m calculator.pseudonymize registry.xlsx ehr-export/ --key site.key --out shared/ --crosswalk crosswalk.csv
```

   The crosswalk links each pseudonym back to its MRN. Like the key, it stays at the site.

**How the pseudonym is made.** It's the HMAC-SHA256 of the normalized MRN, keyed with the
site's 32-byte key, base32-encoded, lower-cased, cut to 16 characters and prefixed `p-`.
Normalizing makes systems that format MRNs differently agree:
- spaces, hyphens and dots are removed;
- letters are capitalized;
- leading zeros are dropped from an all-digit MRN.

So `00123`, `123` and `1-23` are the same patient. Without the key, a pseudonym can't be
reversed, and a guessed MRN can't be checked against it.

**Doing it elsewhere.** A report writer who pseudonymizes inside their own system can
check their output against this test vector:

| Key file | MRN | Pseudonym |
|---|---|---|
| `cocm-pseudonym-key-v1:AAECAwQFBgcICQoLDA0ODxAREhMUFRYXGBkaGxwdHh8=` | `123` (or `00123`) | `p-47cvhcslcvte5vth` |
| the same | `MRN-0042` | `p-vwwfuzieeoipmduc` |

**FHIR exports** identify each patient by its FHIR id unless you set this otherwise. To use
the MRN, pass `--fhir-patient-identifier` with the system of the `Patient.identifier` that
holds it, or use the same setting under *FHIR options* on the page.

### Event dates in local time

Every date must be when the event happened, in local time. Use the date of service,
administration or review, not the date of the note, the charge, or the record. Convert
UTC timestamps before taking the date. See [reporting month](../guide/concepts/reporting-month.md).

### How far back to extract

A month's report needs more than a month of data:

| Data | Extract from |
|---|---|
| Episodes | Every episode that overlaps the month |
| Contacts and scales for the caseload | Each open episode's enrollment date. The baseline and the inactivity rule both need the full episode |
| Case reviews | <!--rule:psychiatric-case-review.window_days-->60<!--/rule--> days before month end |
| Coverage | Every coverage period that overlaps the month |
| Practice visits | The month |
| PHQ-2, PHQ-9 and PHQ-A across the practice | <!--rule:extraction.phq_history_months-->13<!--/rule--> months: <!--rule:what-counts-as-screened.lookback_months-->12<!--/rule--> for metric 9, and <!--rule:initial-phq-9.lookback_days-->365<!--/rule--> days before each PHQ-9 for metric 10 |

### What to disclose

When a site fills a gap with a substitute, it says so in its submission:

- enrollment inferred from billing;
- a primary scale taken from the default mapping, not recorded;
- the rule used to decide which contacts delivered treatment;
- contacts with no recorded author, counted as the BHCM's;
- a screening workflow that differs from the guide's (for example, adults only).

## The monthly routine

| When | What |
|---|---|
| During the month | Document contacts, scales and case reviews as they happen; log outreach attempts |
| Last week of the month | Review the caseload for anyone near <!--rule:inactivity-discharge.days-->90<!--/rule--> days without a clinical contact |
| Month end to the <!--rule:when-to-run-the-report.earliest_run_day-->15<!--/rule-->th | Wait for late notes and charges to be entered. Don't run the report yet |
| On or after the <!--rule:when-to-run-the-report.earliest_run_day-->15<!--/rule-->th | Run the extracts; calculate the metrics; review the patients each rate didn't count |
| Before the NYS deadline | Submit the eleven numbers and the disclosures |
