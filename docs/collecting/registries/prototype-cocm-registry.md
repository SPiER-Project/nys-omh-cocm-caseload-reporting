# Mapping: a prototype CoCM registry → data contract

This page maps the data model of a prototype CoCM registry (Next.js + Prisma +
PostgreSQL) to the [data contract](../../reference/data-contract.md). It is the first registry
mapping (the [registry route](../overview.md#2-a-registry-product-plus-an-ehr-report)),
and also a worked example of what a mapping has to decide. Where it applies a rule from
the guide, it links to the page that sets the rule.

**Mapped against:** the registry's Prisma schema as of 2026-03. No export code exists yet.

## Summary

The registry covers the CoCM half of the contract (T3–T6), with one gap in each table. It
has nothing for the EHR half: coverage (T2) and practice visits (T7) must come from the
practice-management system, which is the two-source pattern every site will have.

| Metric | From the registry alone? |
|---|---|
| 1 Total enrollment | Yes, once the [status rules](#episode-status) are settled |
| 2–4 | No: they need coverage (T2) |
| 5 Contact rate | Needs coverage, and [T4's gap](#t4-contact--patientcontact) overstates it |
| 6–8 | Needs coverage; only patients whose primary scale is PHQ-9 or GAD-7 |
| 9–10 | No: EHR |
| 11 | No: attested |

## T1 `patient` ← `Patient`

| Contract | Registry | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `patient_id` | keyed hash of `Patient.mrn` | Not `Patient.id`, which is an internal id the EHR never sees; the two sources would never join ([one patient id](../overview.md#one-patient-id)) |
| `birth_date` | `dateOfBirth` | Only metric 9 uses it, and metric 9's patients come from the EHR |

## T2 `coverage` ← nothing usable

`Patient.insurance` is one JSON object (`payerId`, `memberId`, `planName`, `groupNumber`).
It has no dates, so the [first-of-month rule](../../guide/concepts/medicaid.md#the-rule) cannot be applied; no payer category,
so Medicaid can only be guessed from `planName`; and no history. **Coverage comes from
the practice-management system.**

## T3 `cocm_episode` ← `Episode`

| Contract | Registry | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `episode_id`, `patient_id` | `id`, `patientId` | |
| `enrollment_date` | `startDate` | Entered by the user at enrollment. Nothing in the schema says whether it is the initial assessment date or the referral date ([enrollment date](../../guide/concepts/enrollment-and-discharge.md#enrollment-date)) |
| `enrollment_source` | `registry` | Constant |
| `primary_condition` | the `diagnoses` entry with `isPrimary`, by ICD-10 range | F32, F33 → `depression`; F41 → `anxiety`; F43.1 → `ptsd`; F90 → `adhd`; else `other`. **Gap:** the schema allows zero or several primary entries; both are extraction errors |
| `primary_scale` | — | **Gap.** Derived from `primary_condition` by the [default mapping](../../guide/concepts/scales-and-outcomes.md#primary-scale), and disclosed. The registry stores only PHQ-9 and GAD-7, so PTSD and ADHD episodes have no scale |
| `diagnosis_date` | — | |
| `discharge_date` | `endDate` | **Gap:** optional even on `FINISHED`. Do not fall back to `updatedAt` or the audit log: those are documentation dates, which is the [backdating error](../../guide/concepts/enrollment-and-discharge.md#discharge). Without an end date, the [inactivity rule](../../guide/concepts/enrollment-and-discharge.md#discharge) still closes the episode 90 days after the last clinical contact |
| `discharge_reason` | `dischargeReason` | Free text; needs a lookup to the contract's list, else `other` |

### Episode status

| `status` | Contract meaning |
|---|---|
| `PLANNED`, `WAITLIST` | Not enrolled; these are referral states ([what counts as enrolled](../../guide/concepts/enrollment-and-discharge.md#enrolled)). Not extracted |
| `ACTIVE`, `ONHOLD` | Enrolled. On hold still counts in the denominators until discharged |
| `FINISHED` | Discharged on `endDate` |
| `CANCELLED` | **Depends on the prior status.** From `PLANNED` or `WAITLIST`: never enrolled, not extracted. From `ACTIVE` or `ONHOLD`: a discharge. Only the audit log records which |

## T4 `contact` ← `PatientContact`

This is the weakest mapping.

| Contract | Registry | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `contact_id`, `patient_id`, `contact_date` | `id`, `patientId`, `date` | No episode link; contacts are attributed to an episode by date |
| `modality` | `type` | `PHONE`, `VIDEO`, `IN_PERSON` map directly |
| `contact_kind` | `type` and `successful` | `PORTAL_MESSAGE`, `EMAIL` → `message`. `successful = false` → `outreach_attempt`. **Gap:** `successful = true` means the patient was reached, not that treatment was delivered; a scheduling call looks the same as a session |
| `staff_role` | — | **Gap:** no author. Extracted as `bhcm`, and disclosed |
| `with_caregiver` | — | |

**Use the stricter rule for `treatment`.** A reached contact counts as treatment only if
a `ClinicalNote` of type `PROGRESS` or `PHONE` exists for that patient on the same day.
That is the "corroborating documentation" NYS asks for in a
[clinical contact](../../guide/concepts/contacts-and-reviews.md#clinical-contact). Notes carry only
`createdAt` (entry time), so a note written the next morning misses; widen the match to
the next calendar day if that's common at the site. Disclose the rule used.

Without the note check, every reached call, including scheduling calls, counts as
treatment, and metric 5 is overstated.

## T5 `scale_result` ← `AssessmentScore`

This is the cleanest mapping.

| Contract | Registry | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `result_id`, `patient_id` | `id`, `patientId` | |
| `administered_date` | `administeredAt` | Stored in UTC. **Convert to the site's time zone before taking the date** ([reporting month](../../guide/concepts/reporting-month.md#the-rule)), or an evening score on the last day of the month falls in the next month |
| `instrument` | `instrumentType` | `PHQ9` → `phq9`, `GAD7` → `gad7`, `PHQ2` → `phq2`. `GAD2` and `CSSRS` are not NYS instruments and are not extracted |
| `total_score` | `totalScore` | |
| `administered_by_role` | `performer.role` | `BHCM` → `bhcm`, `PCP` → `medical_provider`, else `other`. The performer is whoever "administered or entered" it, so this is weak evidence |
| `loinc` | `loincCode` | Check the GAD-7 code: the registry's documentation gives `69737-5`, which is the GAD-7 panel. The total score is `70274-6` ([instruments](../../reference/instruments.md#loinc-codes)) |

A score dated before the episode's `startDate` is a screening score entered into the
episode. Extract it anyway: its date alone rules it out as the
[baseline](../../guide/concepts/scales-and-outcomes.md#baseline), and it may count for
[screening](../../guide/concepts/screening.md#screening-or-monitoring).

## T6 `psych_review` ← `Consultation`

| Contract | Registry | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `review_id`, `patient_id`, `review_date` | `id`, `patientId`, `consultationDate` | One row per patient, the shape the contract requires |
| `recommendation_documented` | `recommendations` is non-empty after trimming | Required in the schema, but an empty string passes |
| `recommendation_to` | — | Not captured |

Not sources for T6: `TimeEntry` with `SCR_PARTICIPATION` (meeting attendance; see [psychiatric case review](../../guide/concepts/contacts-and-reviews.md#psychiatric-case-review-metric-8)), and `ClinicalNote` of type `SCR` (one note per caseload review, not per patient).

## T7 `practice_visit`, T8 `site_month`

T7 comes from the EHR. The registry stores no FTE for T8; `TimeEntry` minutes per BHCM per
month could cross-check an attested figure, but logged time is not scheduled effort.

## Changes to the registry that would close the gaps

1. `PatientContact`: a performer, a purpose (treatment / outreach / scheduling), and an
   episode link. This is the one that fixes metric 5.
2. `Episode`: a `primaryScale`; `endDate` required on `FINISHED`; `dischargeReason` as an
   enum.
3. A coverage history table with a payer category, if the registry should report
   metrics 2–8 without the practice-management system.
4. `Consultation.recommendationTo`.
5. PCL-5, SMFQ, SCARED, PSC-17 and Vanderbilt, for pediatric or PTSD caseloads, and the
   PHQ-A for adolescents.
