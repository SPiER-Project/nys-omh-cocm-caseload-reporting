# The workbook route

This route is for sites whose CoCM registry is a spreadsheet, or that have no report
writer. The site fills in the reporting workbook each month, from its registry spreadsheet and two or
three standard reports, then adds the workbook to the
[calculator page](https://spier-project.github.io/nys-omh-cocm-caseload-reporting/).
The page calculates the eleven metrics in the browser; the workbook is never uploaded.

## Download

- [Blank workbook](https://spier-project.github.io/nys-omh-cocm-caseload-reporting/cocm-workbook.xlsx)
- [Example workbook](https://spier-project.github.io/nys-omh-cocm-caseload-reporting/cocm-workbook-example.xlsx),
  filled with the guide's [example caseload](../guide/example-caseload.md). Add it to the
  calculator page to see how the numbers come out.

They open in Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers and LibreOffice.

If you're producing the data from a registry export or an EHR report instead, the same
tables are available as CSVs: [CSV templates](https://spier-project.github.io/nys-omh-cocm-caseload-reporting/cocm-csv-templates.zip), one file per table with its
headings, and the [example as CSVs](https://spier-project.github.io/nys-omh-cocm-caseload-reporting/cocm-csv-example.zip).

## What's in it

- **Instructions:** how to fill it in.
- **One tab per table** of the [data contract](../reference/data-contract.md), with the
  column names in the first row:
  - a dropdown on every column with fixed values;
  - date and number checks;
  - a note on each column, shown when you click into it.
- **Columns:** every column of every tab, with what it holds and the values it allows.

The workbook is built from the data contract by `scripts/build_workbook.py`, so its
columns always match what the calculator reads.

## Filling it in

- **Use the MRN as the patient id on every tab,** never a name, so it matches the EHR.
  The workbook and the results stay at the site. To share the tables without MRNs, load
  the site's pseudonym key on the calculator page before adding the workbook (see
  [one patient id](overview.md#one-patient-id)).
- **One row per fact,** not one row per patient:
  - one `cocm_episode` row per enrollment, so a returning patient gets a new row;
  - one `contact` row per contact or outreach attempt;
  - one `scale_result` row per completed, scored scale;
  - one `psych_review` row per patient discussed.

  A tick column such as "contacted this month" isn't enough to calculate the metrics,
  which need the date and kind of each contact.
- **Add each month's rows; don't start over.** The calculator looks back as far as it
  needs: to each episode's enrollment for contacts and scales, and
  <!--rule:extraction.phq_history_months-->13<!--/rule--> months for practice-wide PHQs.
  Keep one workbook going, and add the new month's facts to it.
- **Fill in one `site_month` row** for the month being reported: BHCM FTE, the screening
  age floor, and how contacts were judged to be treatment.

## Where each tab's facts come from

| Tab | From |
|---|---|
| `patient`, `cocm_episode`, `contact`, `scale_result`, `psych_review` | The registry spreadsheet |
| `coverage` | A coverage report from the practice-management system: patient, payer, plan, effective dates. Map each plan to a payer category using the site's [payer mapping](../guide/concepts/medicaid.md#what-the-program-should-do) |
| `practice_visit` | A visits report: patient, visit date, provider type, billing codes. This is the hardest report, and the one most worth asking a vendor or billing service to set up once |
| `scale_result` (screening) | A PHQ-2 and PHQ-9 report for the whole practice: patient, date, instrument, score |
| `site_month` | The program lead |

## What a registry spreadsheet often lacks

| Needed | Often missing? |
|---|---|
| Enrollment date: the date of the initial assessment | Sometimes the referral date instead |
| Discharge date and reason | Often blank for patients who drifted away |
| Primary diagnosis and **primary scale** | Primary scale usually missing |
| Each scale result with its own date | Dates often missing; a score in the "March" column isn't enough near month end |
| Each contact, with whether treatment was delivered | Often a single "contacted this month" tick, with no way to tell a session from a reminder call |
| Outreach attempts | Often not recorded |
| Each psychiatric case review, with whether a recommendation was documented | Often a single "reviewed" tick |

## Checks before submitting

- Does the number of enrolled patients match the caseload the BHCMs think they have?
- Does every patient enrolled <!--rule:seventy-days.days-->70<!--/rule--> days or more have a primary scale and a baseline?
- Is anyone enrolled with no clinical contact in the last <!--rule:inactivity-discharge.days-->90<!--/rule--> days? They should be
  re-engaged or discharged.
- Does every Medicaid managed care plan in the coverage report appear in the payer
  mapping?
- Read the calculator's list of patients each rate didn't count, and why. The patients on it
  should be the ones the team would expect.
