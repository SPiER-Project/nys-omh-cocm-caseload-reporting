# Example caseload

This page sets out one small, invented CoCM caseload. Every metric page from
[metric 1](metrics/01-total-enrollment.md) to [metric 8](metrics/08-psychiatric-consultation-rate.md)
uses it. Each page uses the part of the data it needs, so the eight results below all come
from the same patients.

**Reporting month:** March 2025. The metric 8 review window is 31 January to 31 March.

The same patients are test data in [`tests/fixtures/example-caseload`](../../tests/fixtures/example-caseload),
in the format the data contract sets out, with the expected results in `expected.toml`. Any tool that
calculates the metrics should reproduce the results below from it.

## The patients

## Their scores and contacts

The table shows March in detail. Every patient also had a treatment contact at least
monthly from enrollment until March, except P4, whose last contact was on 10 December;
P4's calls since then went unanswered.

## Derived facts

The calculator, or the report writer, derives these from the two tables above. The
concept pages explain each rule.

| Patient | Enrolled this month? | Medicaid? | Days in treatment | 70+ days? | Active treatment? | Improved? | In remission? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | Yes | Yes | 147 | Yes | Yes | Yes: 8 is below 10 | No: 8 isn't below 5 |
| P2 | Yes | Yes | 19 | No | Yes | — | No |
| P3 | Yes | Yes | 84 | Yes | Yes | Yes: 7 is below 10 | No |
| P4 | Yes, discharged 10 Mar | Yes | 160, to discharge | Yes | No: no contact or scale | No: 12 is neither below 10 nor half of 16 | No: no score in March |
| P5 | Yes | No | 56 | No | Yes | — | — |
| P6 | Yes | Yes | 119 | Yes | Yes | No: 8 points better, needs 12 | No: 40 isn't below 33 |
| P7 | Yes | Yes | 196 | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Yes**: 3 is below 5 |
| P8 | Yes | Yes | 105 | Yes | Yes | Not assessed: no elevated baseline | No: 4 is below 5, but no elevated baseline |
| P9 | Yes, discharged 21 Mar | Yes | 102, to discharge | Yes | Yes | Yes | **Yes**: 4 on 14 Mar |
| P10 | No | Yes | — | — | — | — | — |

Metrics 9 and 10 use the whole practice, not the caseload; their example is on the
[screening](concepts/screening.md#worked-example) page. Metric 11's is on the
[BHCM FTE](concepts/bhcm-fte.md#worked-example) page.
